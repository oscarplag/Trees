Given a complete binary tree with nodes of values of either 1 or 0, the following rules always hold :
(1) a node's value is 1 if and only if all its subtree nodes' values are 1
(2) a leaf node can have value either 1 or 0
Implement the following 2 APIs :
	set_bit(offset, length), set the bits at range from offset to offset + length - 1
	clear_bit(offset, length), clear the bits at range from offset to offset + length - 1

	i.e.The tree is like :
			 0
			/ \
		 0        1
		/ \		 / \
	  1    0    1    1
	/ \	  / \  /
   1  1  1   0 1
Since it's complete binary tree, the nodes can be stored in an array:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
